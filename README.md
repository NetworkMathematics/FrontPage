# Network Mathematics.

Network Mathematics is a broad project to apply the modern tools of NLP and AI to the mathematical literature. That is to mathematics written in what is now called "informal" mathematics.

We're working on several subprojects: 

1. Parmesan, now called *Mathscope*  is a math assistant website built mostly by Jacob Collard. (See the assistant at http://www.jacobcollard.com/parmesan2/) 
 We have some publications:
   * Jacob Collard, Valeria de Paiva, Eswaran Subrahmanian. 2024. [Mathematical Entities: Corpora and Benchmarks.](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.966/)
    Proceedings of the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation. LREC-COLING 
   * Jacob Collard, Valeria de Paiva, Eswaran Subrahmanian. 2023. [Parmesan: mathematical concept extraction for education.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06699) ArXiv preprint. 2307.06699.
   * Jacob Collard, Valeria de Paiva, Brendan Fong, and Eswaran Subrahmanian. 2022. [Extracting Mathematical Concepts from Text.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13830) ArXiv preprint. 2208.13830.

2. MathGloss is a multisource glossary of concepts in mathematics built mostly by Lucy Horowitz. (You can see the glossary at  https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/database).
   The initial work was presented at a workshop associated with  CICM 2023, see also https://europroofnet.github.io/cambridge-2023/#horowitz. The preprint can be found at
   * [MathGloss: Building mathematical glossaries from text ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12649), 2023 

3. MathAnnotator is a tool to help annotate math concepts in sentences. The tool is available at https://gaoq111.github.io/math_concept_annotation/.  Our preprint is:
   * [Extracting Mathematical Concepts with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00642) CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org), 2023.
  
4. We propose to process (using spaCy) as many of the open-source maths books recommended by AIM (American Institute of Mathematics)  in their [Open Textbook Initiative](https://textbooks.aimath.org/). This is work with Andrea Ferreira, see:
   *  [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/andreago9/MathCorpus-LAHefferonPDF)
   *  [Abstract Algebra](https://github.com/andreago9/MathCorpus-AATA)
